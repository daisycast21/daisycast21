## Hi there👋 ! My name is Daisy, welcome to my Github! 

### 👩🏽‍🎓About Me

I received my Masters in Public Health with a focus on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. Along the way, my interest in research and Data Analytics grew with every project. I have multiple years of experience with health care data. This experience has aided me in executing data-driven decision-making to plan and implement programs that help diminish the prevalence of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, COVID-19, etc.
